# Hi, I'm zero2sudo! 

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm **zero2sudo**, a Gen Z creator talking about my personal experiences around  **breaking into tech** and **investing in real estate**. 

There's a lot of stuff online about these topics, but in my experience, the hardest part about being new to anything is figuring out what resources are good, and what path you should take. 

Now that I have a few years of experience under my belt, I want to share the resources that I've found most helpful on my journey. They might not map perfectly to your situation, but hopefully they can help!

# Coding Resources

## Learn Python

I organized the resources I used to learn Python in this Google Doc:
[Learn Python on TikTok Table of Contents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeZE92qQMW8QP6EH08DnEP5rcHwBowXwhqtALgDKPBw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learn Frontend Engineering

I'm a professional Frontend Software Engineer in Silicon Valley. and [Frontend Masters](www.frontendmasters.com) is by far my favorite resource for learning Frontend at a professional level.  **Frontend Masters does not sponsor me**. _Their stuff is just that good_.

If you're a complete beginner, start with their [beginner learning path](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/). The [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) is 100% free, and a great class to dip your toes into web development.

# Real Estate Investing

## Airbnb Investing
Owning Airbnbs is my favorite way to invest in Real Estate. Airbnb has allowed me to capture amazing cash on cash return in markets with insane appreciation, which is _really hard to do_ in 2022. 

Building an Airbnb business has also been an amazing way for me to practice systematizing my processes, and has enabled me to employ locals in my community. Win-win :) 

### Free Airbnb Deal Analysis Spreadsheet
I made this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vzEiDGUP6ygfqx3g54QC5_wEeCPTSNh68822gCn6d0/edit?usp=sharing) with [The CPA Dude](https://tiktok.com/@thecpadude) to show you how I think about Airbnb acquisitions. Save a copy to your Google Drive if you'd like to play around with it. Give him a follow if you find it helpful - he built most of the spreadsheet.
